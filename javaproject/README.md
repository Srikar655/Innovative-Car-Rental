It also provides administrative functionalities for staff to manage vehicles, owners, drivers, and rental agreements.

## Technologies Used
*   **Backend**: Java, Servlets
*   **Frontend**: JSP, JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library)
*   **ORM**: Hibernate
*   **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
*   **Build Tool**: Maven
*   **Reporting**: JasperReports
*   **Payment Integration**: Razorpay
*   **Utility Libraries**: Apache Commons (Collections, Digester)
*   **File Upload**: COS (com.servlets)

## Features
*   **Vehicle Management**:
    *   Add, update, and view vehicle details (make, model, type, fuel, capacity).
    *   Manage vehicle inventory.
*   **User Management**:
    *   Customer registration and profile management.
    *   Driver information management.
    *   Vehicle owner information management.

    *   Integration with Razorpay for secure online payments.
    *   Management of bank account details for payouts (e.g., to owners).
*   **Reporting**:
    *   Generate reports (e.g., rental history, vehicle availability) using JasperReports.
*   **Location Services**:
    *   Manage and utilize location data (cities, states, countries) for search and filtering.
*   **Administrative Functions**:
    *   Dashboard for administrators to oversee operations.
    *   Management of system settings and user accounts.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8 or higher.
    *   Apache Maven.
    *   Microsoft SQL Server.
    *   A Servlet container like Apache Tomcat.

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd javaproject
    ```

3.  **Database Configuration**:
    *   Ensure your Microsoft SQL Server instance is running.
    *   You will likely need to update the database connection details (URL, username, password). This is typically found in a Hibernate configuration file (e.g., `hibernate.cfg.xml` or a properties file within the `src/main/resources` directory) or a JPA `persistence.xml` file. *(Note: Exact file location may vary)*.
    *   Create the necessary database schema if it's not automatically generated by Hibernate (check Hibernate configuration for `hbm2ddl.auto` property).

4.  **Build the Project**:
    *   Use Maven to build the project:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```
    *   This will generate a `.war` file (e.g., `simple-webapp.war`) in the `target` directory.

5.  **Deploy the Application**:
    *   Deploy the generated `.war` file to your Servlet container (e.g., copy it to the `webapps` directory of Tomcat).
    *   Start the Servlet container.

6.  **Access the Application**:
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/simple-webapp/` - the context path might vary depending on your deployment).

## How to Use

Once the application is deployed and running:

1.  **Customers**:
    *   Navigate to the application URL in a web browser.
    *   Browse the catalog of available vehicles.
    *   Filter vehicles based on criteria like type, make, model, etc.
    *   View detailed information about a specific vehicle.
    *   Register for an account or log in.
    *   Select rental dates and make a booking.
    *   Proceed to payment using the integrated Razorpay gateway.
    *   Manage their profile and view rental history.

2.  **Administrators / Staff**:
    *   Log in using administrative credentials.
    *   Access the admin dashboard to manage vehicles, customers, drivers, owners, and employees.
    *   Add new vehicles to the inventory and update existing vehicle details.
    *   Manage rental agreements and view booking statuses.
    *   Generate reports on rentals, revenue, and vehicle utilization.
    *   Manage system settings and user roles.
